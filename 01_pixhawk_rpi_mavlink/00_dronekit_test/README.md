## Reminder and warning

1. The codes are written according to Python 2 standard, thus it might not run on Python 3 environment if DroneKit-Python API are ported to Python 3 in future.
2. The codes are only good as reference, because it's specialized to run only on certain RC model (such as Rover) under DroneKit-Python API.
3. The codes are mainly written as Python programming practice thus pardon some ugliness in writing and structure.
4. The codes are numbered to show which steps that need to focus on, this will make debugging bad setup easier to identify problems.
5. Reference on how each of API are being used in this codes can be found at this [link](http://python.dronekit.io/automodule.html).
